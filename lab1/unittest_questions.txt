1. Why is it important to test the boundary conditions of an implementation, especially in the case of count_if_followed_by?

ANS: Because the algorithm might not behave correctly on these conditions (They are easy to miss). If they are missed, the algorithm might not behave as intended.


2.Describe how your testcase tests if a pointer is accessing an element outside the range specified.

ANS: In the case of the file count_if_followed_by, we could test this by giving a sequence of data together with a len equal to the length of the sequence-1. We expected the output 0, but the algorithm (or the pointer) accessed the last element when doing its calculation and therefore got a result equal to 1.
